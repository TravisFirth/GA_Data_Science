    "3. Measure confidence levels in regression equation.\n",

    "**2. Write an alternative problem statement for your dataset**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:** Using available data of 400 students over an undefined time period, test the hypothesis that a lower grade point average (gpa), lower graduate record examination (gre) and/or lower ungraduate school prestige ranking (rank) will lead to a higher probability that a student **won't** be admitted (admit) into graduate school.\n",

    "**3. Articulate the assumptions and risks of the alternative model**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:** The key assumption is that a combination of gpa, gre and rank will be the primary drivers for why a student is not admitted into graduate school.  A key risk in with this alternate model is that some students may self select not to apply for UCLA graduate school and therefore the sample collected will be a subset of the population (only those that applied, not others that would have not been accepted)."
